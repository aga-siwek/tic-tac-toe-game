Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3×3 grid, 
where players take turns marking a space with their symbol 
— one player uses X and the other uses O. 
The objective is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row 
— horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
If all nine spaces are filled without either player achieving three in a row, 
the game ends in a draw.
You have 2 way of play: with another player or with CPU. 
For CPU  was used a MINMAX algorithm
